## Scheduling Jobs in Spring Boot Application

Hola,

Working on Scheduled tasks is a common thing for a Backend developer in Spring Boot. I created a @GitHub repo that talks about scheduling tasks in spring boot application.

App Functionality:

1) For every 5 seconds it creates a new **CreditCard **and persists that in H2 database.

2) For every 10 seconds it will fetch persisted **CreditCards ** from DB.

Note: This is too simple and straight forward app which focuses only on purpose of scheduling jobs.

App Flow:
