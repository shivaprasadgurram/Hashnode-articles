# How to get started with Stack Data Structure?

Hola,

When we thought of learning about a Data Structure or an Algorithm, We may get into confusion about how to start, isn't?

Here are the few points which you can try to get started with **STACK **data structure.


1. What is Stack?

2. Why we need it and how stacks are used?

3. Learn about real time use cases of Stack.

4. Learn about Stack operations like push(int val), pop(), isEmpty(), top(), size(), isFull(), etc.

5. Understand about time and space complexities of each operation.

6. Implement stack using static array (size is fixed).

7. Implement stack using dynamic array (You can give a try on array doubling technic).

8. Implement stack using Linked List.

**PART 2 will be posted soon.**
